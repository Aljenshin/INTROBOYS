In Filipino gaming slang, "intro boys" (or introboys) refers to players who perform well at the start of a game, but ultimately lose the match. It can also describe players who frequently join new game servers, only to leave shortly after. The term is a playful jab, often implying a lack of staying power or consistency. The term is derived from the name of the Filipino pop band INTRoVOYS.
